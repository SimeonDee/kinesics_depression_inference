## About Project
---
This app classifies a social media text, image or both as depressive or non-depressive. It uses SVC and CNN Algorithms to make such inference. The inference app is built with streamlit.


## Environment Setup
---
- Setup a virtual environment and switch to it
To setup a virtual environment, visit [Creation of virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [How to Set Up a Virtual Environment in Python – And Why It's Useful](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)


## Installing Dependencies
---
- To install app dependencies, open command prompt (for windows users) or Terminal (for Mac or Linux users) and run the command below:

```bash
$> pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running the App
---
- To run the streamlit app, goto cmd or Terminal and enter the command below:
```bash
$> streamlit run 1_🏠_Home.py
```


## Stopping the Running App
---
- To stop the running app, go back to the command prompt or terminal and press ```Cntrl + C``` keys on the keyboard.
